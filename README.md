Load up disc 1 in DVD1, normally with any software. 

then open the setup file in it. 

it should start doing magic (just wait) then it will ask you some stuff. 

You can customize or just click next through it. 

Then it will say insert Disc 2. 

This is important. Eject disc 1 first (don't worry it won't break). Then load up disc 2 in DVD2 and press ok. Then its done. 

Now for the crack part. IN the crack folder (both are same), copy all the .dll files and go to the installation folder; Program Files x86 / Microsoft Games / Flight Sim X /. There paste it and confirm replace.
